### Problem Statement
Over the last 25 years I've built up quit a large movie collection, and sometimes I find myself unable to decide what movie to watch when I'm in the mood for a movie.

myMovies will aim to solve that problem by making suggestions on what to watch based on the season and current weather conditions.
